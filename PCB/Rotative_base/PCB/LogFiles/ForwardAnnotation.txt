     A new Target PDB will be created from the Central Library to satisfy the parts
      requirements of the iCDB.

     The schematic source is a Common Data Base.

     The AllowAlphaRefDes status indicates that reference
      designators containing all alpha characters should be deleted
      and the relevant symbols repackaged.
