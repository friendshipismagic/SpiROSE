            Job Name: D:\SpiROSE\PCB\Rotative_base\Rotative_base.prj


     Packager     Version: 020806.00

        Commandline is: "D:\MentorGraphics\EEVX.2.2\SDD_HOME\wg\win32\bin\package "-uD:\SpiROSE\PCB\Rotative_base\Default\default.icdb" -k -CleanBuild "-jD:\SpiROSE\PCB\Rotative_base\Rotative_base.prj" "

     The Common Database is at "D:\SpiROSE\PCB\Rotative_base\Default\default.icdb".

     The Root of this design is "Schematic1".

     The Front End Snapshot of this design is "DCDV".

     The PCB Design Path of this design is at "D:\SpiROSE\PCB\Rotative_base\PCB\PCB.pcb".

     The Central Library is at "F:\Central_Libs\ENST.lmc".
      However, "F:\Central_Libs\ENST.lmc" does not exist.

     The Disable Repackage status indicates that 
      Repackaging should be allowed.

     A new Target PDB was to be created from the Central Library to satisfy the parts
      requirements of the iCDB.  However, since there is no Central Library,
      the Local PDB will be searched to satisfy the parts requirements of the iCDB.

     The AllowAlphaRefDes status indicates that reference
      designators containing all alpha characters should be deleted
      and the relevant symbols repackaged.

     The cross mapping of symbol pin names to Part Number pin
      numbers will be checked for packaged symbols and mapped correctly
      for unpackaged symbols.

     Since a Central Library does not exist, there are no properties that have
      been checked off in a Property Definition Editor to be found at Library 
      Manager/Common Properties to be checked for value differences between the
      PartsDB and the non-null properties on symbols.

	Checking for errors in the ICDB...

	No errors found.  Proceeding with packaging...



    WARNING: Block Schematic1, Page 1, Symbol XCMP948:
     Reference designator removal.
     The Reference Designator "C" is being removed
     from Symbol.  Such 'all alpha' designators that are
     not instance properties are usually built into symbols and are 
     not intended as a request to be packaged in the same pack with

     Checking for value differences between non-null symbol properties and PartsDB properties,
      but only for those properties checked off in the Property Definition Editor
     Since no properties were checked off, no symbols will be checked.

     Checking the validity of the packaging of prepackaged schematic
      symbols.  Only the first error in symbols having the same
      Reference Designator will be reported.

     The packaging of all prepackaged schematic symbols is consistent
      with the Parts DataBase data for the cross mapping of
      symbol pin names to Part Number pin numbers.
      Symbols that were not prepackaged will now be packaged correctly.
      
     No errors in Existing Schematic Packaging.

     The Common DataBase has been read and will be packaged.
