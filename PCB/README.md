# Files

The final PCB are in the `Rotative_Base` and `LED_Panel` directories.


# Other

In `misc/`, you can find:

+ the EAGLE `pcb-test-driver/`, containing a useful PCB to test the LED drivers with some LED and multiplexing.
+ a `LED_Panel_4_layers` almost finished version with 4 layers (instead of 6) of the LED panel.
